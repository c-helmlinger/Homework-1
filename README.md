# Homework-1
In today's classes, I learned about the ways that knowledge of data and AI can be used in a career path, including Software Engineering and AI researching, which are two different paths but have much to do with each other. I found this particularly enlightening because it showed me two different, or even intertwined, ways that I could be able to continue use of my knowledge from this course. We proceeded to talk about how data is used to help AI machines make educated guesses and predictions pertaining to this data. It was very interesting to me to learn about the different types of data, continual and discrete, that are used by the computer in different ways. I was aware of the variable formula, where y equals a function of x, but I did not know how ot apply this to computer programming, which was another interesting thing I learned today. Lastly, I knew nothing about R code previously, so this is my first attempt at using R.
